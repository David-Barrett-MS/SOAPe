SOAPe is sample code and is used entirely at your own risk.  It is a tool for testing Exchange Web Services and other SOAP services.  The log analyzer has automatic error/throttling highlighting and can import EWS traces generated by other applications.

This application saves configuration information automatically when closed.  This information is saved to a file that is encrypted to the current user's account.  Other users logging in on the same machine and using SOAPe will have their own configuration, and will not be able to decrypt others.

You can add and manage multiple configurations using the Configuration Manager.  All configurations are saved to the same encrypted file.
