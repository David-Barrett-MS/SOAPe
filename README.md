# SOAPe
An application that allows testing of SOAP implementations, with extra features targeting Exchange Web Services.  It includes an HTTP listener which means that it can be used to test Exchange push subscriptions, and there are various EWS templates included for convenience.

SOAPe also incorporates an EWS trace analyser that can import traces from other EWS applications.  SOAPeâ€™s log viewer allows you to analyse EWS trace logs quickly and identify errors or pinpoint particular events.
